# Tanzu GitOps Reference Implementation

An **opinionated, ready-to-use GitOps workflow** to deploy the **Tanzu Application Platform (TAP)** into Kubernetes clusters.

---

## Overview

This repository provides a GitOps-based approach for:

- Automating **TAP installations** using version-controlled configuration.
- Enforcing consistent and reproducible environments across clusters.
- Streamlining deployment through **declarative manifests** and overlays.

It includes cluster-ready templates, environment directories, and a setup script to help you bootstrap quickly.

## Quickstart

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/clarkjo-commit/tap-gitops.git
   cd tap-gitops
   ```

2. **Run the setup script**

   ```bash
   ./setup-repo.sh
   ```

   This initializes repo scaffolding and helps align with your GitOps pipeline.

3. **Customize cluster overlays**

   Update configuration under `clusters/` to match your environments.

4. **Deploy using a GitOps operator**

   Point [FluxCD](https://fluxcd.io/) or [Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/) at this repository. The GitOps controller will reconcile your configuration and deploy TAP automatically.

## Why GitOps for TAP?

* **Reproducibility** → Declarative configs ensure consistent environments.
* **Auditability** → Git history tracks every change.
* **Safety** → Easy rollbacks and drift detection.
* **Velocity** → Rapid onboarding and streamlined upgrades.

---

## Prerequisites

* A Kubernetes cluster (Tanzu Kubernetes Grid, vSphere-backed, or equivalent).
* Access to **Tanzu Application Platform artifacts** and a valid license.
* A GitOps operator (e.g., Argo CD or FluxCD) installed and configured.
* Sufficient permissions to manage namespaces and cluster resources.
